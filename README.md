Pox
===


Pox is (yet another) PHP MVC web framework with the following features.

- Built-in caching layer transparently caches business objects to a global,
  shared memory (memcached, eaccelerator, APC, etc).
- Data is lazily-loaded enabling objects to be instantiated without hitting the
  database.
- Collections of objects are automatically handled and lazily loaded as the data
  is paged.
